# Focus
focus iis selecting an element and directing all keyboard event o a selected element
tab order - the order elements are selected in the document
Tab order should make sence to end users. Tab order may be unpredictable when styles applied.

# Controlling focus with tab index

# Roving tabindex
custom html elements

The reason why element are important cuz they allow to jump directly to your navigation
main
article
aside
nav
footer
headings

Browser parser html, creates dom tree, generrates GUI, generates acessibility tree (assistevi tech works with it).

some elemets has implicit cemantics. nuilt in (password inputs, buttons)
div is a generic grouping element.

aria live region - is a part of the page where we told the screenreader - hey we gonna update this thing.

skip links - when you first click tab it shows link 'skip to main content'.
Extremely usable on sites with heavy navigation.

A11y Checklist
1. SKip link
2. all interactive objects are accessible via tab
3. no focusable offscreen content
4. check page landmarks
5. color and contrast


if img text is not provided voic e will read file name

aria attributes allows you to add additional sematics to elements. it only modifies acessibility tree.
element appearance, behavior, focusABILIty or keyboard event handling are not affected.

aria roles hhas inheritance

axe library for a11y auto testing

# Focus ring
Removing focus ring with `outline: none` style is a bad practice, because you remove it for all useres. If user uses a  mouse FR is non relevant, but for keyboard users it is.
you better apply focus ring css rule (lvl 4 css spec)

# Heading
USe headings in order coz they form skeleton of the page in accessibility tree.
Usually devs wanna skip heading levels coz they have built-in styling

Focus follows acessibility tree which is based on dom. It ignores css, so repositioning elements may violate acessibility

======================
wcag core principles (POUR)
perseivable
operable
understandable
robust

native elements are automatically inserted in taborder

screen reader expresses element role name state and value

two types of labels: vissual labels and text alternative

empty alt text removes an image from a11y tree

links are used as landmarks, so its important to not misuse it
do js-based navigation via non <a> tag. this is popular flaw in SPA's
Assigning onclick handler performing some job to <a> tag
implement smth as a link but used as a button
non informativve tex. eg learn more

ccorrect links usage will:
show up links in links list
enable keyboard interaction
allow user to bookmark links

HTML allows you to express acessibiliyty semantics by default.
WAI Aria allows you to handle situations when native HTML mechanisms are not enough. eg building custyom controls

aria works by allowing you to specify element attributes, which modify the way it element appears in acessibility tree

role - term amounts to a shorthand for a particular UI pattern.

Hiding elements from assistive tech
elements that are hidden will not appear in acessibility tree. (display: none, visibility: hidden, or dhidden html attribute)
aria-hidden attribute is exclude node freom acessibility tree which is not visually hidden

you can position screen reader-only text in an element which absolutely positioned far off screen
