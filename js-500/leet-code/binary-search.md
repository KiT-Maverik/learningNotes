Angorithm - a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.

Binary search is a textbook algorithm based on the idea to compare the target value to the middle element of the array.
Binary Search is an algorithm that divides the search space in 2 after every comparison.

Binary Search is generally composed of 3 main sections:
* Pre-processing - Sort if collection is unsorted.
* Binary Search - Using a loop or recursion to divide search space in half after each comparison.
* Post-processing - Determine viable candidates in the remaining space

template 1 for searching particular value
template 2 for searching first value of the sequence (e.g. first bad version)
