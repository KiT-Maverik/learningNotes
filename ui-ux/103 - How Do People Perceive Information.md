# Visual Perception


fields of vision 
peripheral on central vision differences

informatioon is obtained wivually by suquenced eyes fixation (saccades). Basically user is jumping between points of interest. The same can be applied to reaading.

f-pattern

Principles
Make important info & actions visible.	
	Dont hide it behind complex structure or out ot the standard viewport
Leverage the read
	use profits of known patterns, such as F-pattern
When evaluating, ask yourself "didthey see it?"
	didnt they see a link because they gave up before they get to it? Or because it was pretty poorly visible?

1. features. colors, shades, linee angles
2. shapes sor groups of shapes
3. objects . interpre those patterns as objects we recorgnize

features detection
set of primitive features our eyes see instantly
	colors
	shades
	angles
	slopes
	regions with different texture
	motion

very ffast
allows pop-out (attract attentions coz its pops out of the flow)
supports subsequent stages (patterns and objects)

# Memory
 process of memoring
 sensory register
 perception
 short term memory
 long term memory

short term memory
limited capacity  7+-2, or event 4+-1
information that is not retained is lost
reatined means committed to long term memory
aslso known as learning

This derive
Principles
keep list of options short
gie users ytoools for reducing options
Dont expect user to remember stuff (if the info from prior screen is not visible, there is high chance it will be lost, unless users have string motivation to remember it)


# Long term memory
containes everything we remember mo then few seconds
must b ecopied from the short temr memory (learning)

Transfer ways
	assosiation (объект ассоциируется  с уже известными нам объектами)
	reperirion ()

if no assotiation for new object we commit it to memorization or elaborative rehearsal (repetition ibnfo until it goes to long term memory)

likelihood of remembering
	strength of association (how closely is it associated with the information user already have)
	Recency (how recently were they exposed the information)
	Frequency (how frequently they had to recall this info)

Memories are often primed (основан или рассчитан?) by stimuli that we receive

So we can present information that will fit into users schema by using metaphors, leveraging standards and consistency. And also when we do present information that fits into users' schemas we avoid asking them to memorize stuff and make it more likely that they'll be able to remember it when they need that information later.

prefer recognition over recall whenever possible.

metaphor (shopping cart)
consistency asccoss similar products (our or third party) - look at office, google docs and basically any rich-tex editing tool toolbar.

And what this means is that a user who has learned to use one of these systems in picking up the other one will immediately know where to find certain types of operations, like cut, copy, and paste, or save or rename, or those types of things.``
