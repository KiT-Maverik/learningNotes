how people act

seven stages of action
forming the goal
Forming intention
selecting the avtion
executing the action
persieve the state of the world (post change)
interpret the state of the world
evaluating the outcome
(image?)

Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
1-4 gulf of execution
5-7 gulf of action


bridging the gulfs
understand
	Users goals
	how they thisk about accomplishing them
Make sure likely actionas are
	visible
	make sense
Make sure likely results of actionas are
	visible
	make sense

examples
glass doors. its not obvious what door to push to get inside (actions are not visile)
traffic light switch. You push the button, and if there is no light you will not receive a feedback (results are not visible)

# Design Principles

2 notes 


## affordance
An affordance is a feature of an object or an environment that indicates the possibility of action.

## Signifiers 
an indication of what action will occur and, in many cases, where the action can ocucr (basically a sign)

Affordances of done well can communicate intuitively
Signifiers are often necessary when many actions are possible
Conventions and standards can reduce the need of affordances

## Feedback
user needs to know that the system has received their input
user needs to know what the system did with their input

## Constraints
Unavailable actions hould be disabled
Limiting the total number of options will make selection easier


And so, by constraining the actions that the user is able to take, we're able to keep them from taking an action that won't lead towards the result that they want, but encourages them to take the actions that are available.

## Conceptual models
And finally, it's important to support the formation of user's conceptual models so that as they interact with the system, they can learn not only how the specific actions work that they've already taken, but how future actions might work using that system. 


Copceptual models support simulation of future actions
Appropriate use of affordances, signifiers, feedback and constraints lead to formation of accurate conceptual models

conceptual model is how user understand system work

## Consistency

use consistency across all the places across the system, so user will learn something in one place and will be able to use their knowledge in others.
